# Python_task_1
- To take user inputs we use input("message prompt") and assign it to variables.
- To concatenate the information in a print statement I used commas to separate the terms.
- ```variable.capitalize()``` is used to capitalise the 1st character of the string.
- ```variable.upper()``` is used to put the variable all in caps.

Example:
```
print("Hello", full_name, "!", "You are {} years old.".format(age), "You live at", address.capitalize(), ",", postcode.upper(), ".", "NI number:", ni_number.upper())
```
